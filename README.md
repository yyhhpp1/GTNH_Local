# Migrating to a New Instance (Recommended)  

This method involves copying files from the current GTNH instance into a new GTNH instance. This is also the only way to transfer saves between launchers.

1. Setup the new launcher and/or GTNH instance. Ensure it can run without issues before making any changes.

2. Copy the following files from the current instance into the new instance.

/saves/ folder. Also includes NEI data.
/backups/ folder (not needed if you keep the old instance).
/journeymap/ folder.
/visualprospecting/ folder, for JourneyMap ore vein data.
/TCNodeTracker/folder, for JourneyMap node data.
/schematics/ folder, for saved schematics.
/resourcepacks/ folder.
/shaderpacks/ folder and /config/shaders.properties file.
/screenshots/ folder.
/localconfig.cfg file, for local config changes.
BotaniaVars.dat file, for Lexica Botania bookmarks and other Botania things.
options.txt file.
optionsnf.txt file.
servers.dat file.

This repo save above files.
